diy-bookscanner
===============
This repo contains, at the moment, the main script for running a [DIY bookscanner](http://www.diybookscanner.org/) using a Raspberry Pi.  The script, bookscanner.py, is derived from Mark Van den Borre's [test_keypedal.sh](https://github.com/markvdb/diybookscanner/blob/master/misc/test_keypedal.sh).  Per correspondence with Mark, this code is released under the AGPL.
